# QRLang-Compressor

The QRLang Compressor was built for the QRLang project. The compressor was created to take in raw QRLang game code and compress and minify it to the QR Code alphanumeric set. This is non-functional on its own as it is a library. For an independantly running version of the compressor see https://github.com/Qoramas/QRLang-GUI.

The Compressor was built seperately to the GUI to allow other developers to use the compressor for their own projects or IDE integration.

## What is QRLang
QRLang is a Game Development language and platform built upon the use of QR codes. A QR Code is a 2 dimensional barcode with an extremely limited amount of space available for storing data. The QRLang language is a very high level, highly compressible scripting language designed to fit an entire game onto a single QR code. There are two forms of users for the app, the development user who writes the games and the end user who plays them.

## Using the Compressor

Using the compressor is very simple. Once the library has been correctly imported then the code should run as it does in Main.java which is an example of the use of the compressor.
